# alacrittySameCWD

A shell script to open a new terminal in the working directory of the active one (on hyprland).<br>
if you are not using alacritty, you can still use the script by changing the TERM value, and the command to open the window in a specific directory at the end of the script to match your terminal one <br>

I made this out of a personnal need.<br>
this script is meant to be triggered by a keybind.<br>
# Download
copy past into some place <br>
name it as you wish<br>
chmod +x [itsName]<br>
and ramplace you're keybind to run alacritty by the script path.
